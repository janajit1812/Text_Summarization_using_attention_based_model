# Text_Summarization_using_attention_based_model
This is my final year college project built using python programming language.
There are basically two types of text summarization: Abstractive and Extractive text summarization. This project maily deals with the extractive format of text summarization. Google Collaboratory, Jupyter Notebook and Python programming language are mainly used to create this project.
Here at first a large paragraph of text is splitted into small sized paragraphs and then each paragraph is splitted into sentences present in the paragraph. 
These sentences are then alloted a score using NLP. 
Only 3-4 sentences with highest score are selected and then rearranged in proper order to form a meaningful paragraph.
Angle deviation between the summzarized paragraph of text and the original text is determined and the angle is tried to be reduced to as minimum as possible.
